<div align="center">

</div>

This repository chronicles my hands-on experience in the VSD System-on-Chip (SoC) Tapeout Program. Here, I'll be documenting my learning and progress on a weekly basis, detailing the tasks completed each step of the way.

Program Mission
To master the complete System-on-Chip design flow, from RTL coding to final GDSII generation, utilizing a suite of open-source EDA tools. This initiative is a cornerstone of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout, bringing together over 3500 participants to engineer silicon and bolster the national semiconductor landscape.
